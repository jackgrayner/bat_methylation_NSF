## Outline
This is a project looking at sex differences in methylation and epigenetic ageing across bat species.

#### filter_metadata_methdata.R
Used to filter existing data, excluding samples from non-skin tissues or without high confidence known ages.

#### run_models.R
Used to run models of proportion of methylated sites against sex and age plus their interaction, and sex-specific models of proportion of methylated sites against age.

#### sex-bias_analysis.R
Plots and analyses of sex-biased and age-associated DMPs

#### sex-specific_ageing_analysis.R
Plots and analyses of sites showing sex-biased slopes of age-related methylation variation
