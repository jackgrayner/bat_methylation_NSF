## Outline
This is a project looking at sex differences in methylation and epigenetic ageing across bat species.

### filter_metadata_methdata.R
Used to filter existing data, excluding samples without high confidence known ages, estimate ages, remove clock sites from methylation data, etc.

### run_models.R
Used to run models of proportion of methylated sites against sex and age plus their interaction, and sex-specific models of proportion of methylated sites against age.
